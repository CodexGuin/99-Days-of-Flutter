- Custom scroll view
- Nested classes
- Richtext and text span

## To work on / Features to be added

## Today todo
- [x] Main page UI
- [x] Modular design
- [x] Dark theme
- [ ] Theme changer

## Bugs
- Possible overflow if > 2 lines for richtext

## Self-reflection for the day
Pretty good progress. Mostly no problem, except for the app bar design. Unsure how to align the title properly using the SliverAppBar widget.

Happy with how modular the code is! Not the best of the best effort, but still passable.

Will be working on the actual chatting page tomorrow, and possibly Firebase integration the following day.
