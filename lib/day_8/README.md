## Brief
Attempted to recreate what I did previously, but more structured.

## Features
- HTTP GET request from endpoint
- Parsing of Json files to something usable
- Business logic seperated from frontend
- Different pages
- Kinda aesthetic UI ( NEED WORK )

## Main learning points
- Android Gradel
- Asynchronos function
- Layout

## To work on / Features to be added
- UI/UX
- Themeing
- BLoC / Provider etc
- Unsure if enums are needed
- Other pages
- Map api ( Done )

## Today todo
- Implement nearby location bus stop ( Not done )
- Beautify UI ( A little )
- Fix bugs and understand Bus.dart fully ( A little )
- Fix bus arrival logic ( Not done )
- Add home screen ( Done )

## Bugs
- Possible crashes if something 'required' is null
- Possible overflow due to layout problems

## Self-reflection for the day
Didnt do much today as well, rough schedule, only spent 1.5 hrs++. Implemented Google Maps api. Learnt quite some stuff about the android gradel thingy. Will definetely spend more time tomorrow, lighter schedule.
