# Day 17 - Desktop Dashboard 3

## Brief

## Features

## Main learning points

## Bugs
- Possible overflow if height < certain amount
- When hovering over sidebar items, cursor should change to click (Fixed)
- When clicking sidebar items, state is only remembered locally within the widget (Need to implement state management) (Fixed)

## Self-reflection for the day
Marginal changes today, had to teach in the morning, run in the afternoon, supper with friends at night...

Researched on draggables, but cant really get it working as intended, so I just added placeholders in the about page.

Will work on this 1 - 2 more days.
