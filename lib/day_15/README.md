## Today todo

- [ ] Working side bar
- [ ] Color design

## Bugs
- Possible overflow if height < certain amount
- When hovering over sidebar items, cursor should change to click
- When clicking sidebar items, state is only remembered locally within the widget (Need to implement state management)

## Self-reflection for the day
Frustrating start. Could'nt get the hang of using expanded and flexible. Embarrasingly spent > 1 hr on just trying to rectify layout problem for the first 3 tiles...

After getting it (not fully, but okay), on to add in the sidebar stuff. Tried making it reactive, but didnt really work. Quit alot of bugs this time. Need to remember to utilize state management for sidebar items.

Will work on this 1 - 2 more days.
