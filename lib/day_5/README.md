# Day 5 - Glassmorphic UI Design

## Brief
My take on a glassmophic login page for my app!

## Features
- Glassmorphic UI design
- AI generated art ( Dall-e 3 )
- Modular design

## Main learning points
- Backdrop filter / Image filters
- Stack
- Modularity of widgets
- ClipRRect widget

## To work on / Features to be added
- Tweak UI more, does'nt really look as nice as I thought it'll be...
- Backend functionality ( Firebase authentication )
- Change background every couple of seconds ( Animated ofc )

## Bugs
- Possible overflow due to design flaw frosted container

## Self-reflection for the day
Decided upon a glassmophic UI design on Day 4. Tried implementing a login page. Got logo and a few backgrounds from Dall-e 3 and unsplash. Spent about an hour familiarizing UI layout design and implementation, and another hour on tweaking of the widgets to my liking. Results were alright at best, still have a novice feel to it, but better than what I could have done before! If I stay on track I'll be good, it's only day 5 afterall!
