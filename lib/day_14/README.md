## Self-reflection for the day
Skipped yesterday as I was really too tired to do anything...

Quite satisfied with today's result, spent less than 2 hrs, but really put in alot of effort! Copilot really helped me alot too lel.

Managed to finish up the other pages. Added in firestore database to store user info and posts. Writing and displaying posts was not much of a problem once I got the hang of it. Settings page still not completed, but I'd give it a close on this project for now. Time to move on!
