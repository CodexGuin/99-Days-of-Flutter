# Day 6 - Rest API

## Brief
Attempted to recreate what I did previously, but more structured.

## Features
- HTTP GET request from endpoint
- Parsing of Json files to something usable
- Business logic seperated from frontend

## Main learning points
- HTTP package
- How API generally works
- Parsing of Json
- ListTiles

## To work on / Features to be added
- UI/UX
- Themeing
- BLoC / Provider etc
- Unsure if enums are needed

## Bugs
- Possible crashes if something 'required' is null

## Self-reflection for the day
Spent really little time on this today. Slightly burnt out from exercising morning and night. Glad I managed to make it work in the end tho! Learnt quite a bit despite little time spent. I think I'll work on this tmr again, just to learn more of UI. Used this [tool](https://app.quicktype.io/) to generate parsing file and modified it to allow for nullable objects.
