## Self-reflection for the day
Spent really little time today, had PASS tutoring in the morning, then lost drive cuz of heat... Packed all my work at the end of the day xd

Rushed the design, but still acceptable! With the help of copilot, I was able to generate alot of code exactly what I wanted really quickly!

Will definetely finish up landing, login, and register page by tmr at least.
