# Day 7 - Rest API 2

## Brief
Attempted to recreate what I did previously, but more structured.

## Features
- HTTP GET request from endpoint
- Parsing of Json files to something usable
- Business logic seperated from frontend
- Different pages
- Kinda aesthetic UI ( NEED WORK )

## Main learning points
- Material Navigator
- Reusing widgets
- Layouts

## To work on / Features to be added
- UI/UX
- Themeing
- BLoC / Provider etc
- Unsure if enums are needed
- Other pages
- Map api

## Today todo
- Implement nearby location bus stop ( Not done )
- Beautify UI ( A little )
- Fix bugs and understand Bus.dart fully ( A little )
- Fix bus arrival logic ( Not done )
- Add home screen ( Done )

## Bugs
- Possible crashes if something 'required' is null
- Possible overflow due to layout problems

## Self-reflection for the day
Spent slightly more tiem today. Start was okay, thoguth about what I wanted to tackle. But I deviated and did added other stuff like the home screen HAHA. I still learnt quite a bit today, so it's still a win! Learnt more about material app, navigation, layouts. Will continue working on this tomorrow!
