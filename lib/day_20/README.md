## Self-reflection for the day
Super happy about today's result!! Spent 1 hr on stories section due to me trying to clone the stories layout exactly.

Spent the next 2.5 hrs on the feed. Had almost no trouble throughout today! Was hyper focused for at least 1.5hrs straight.

Btw the only reason why this took so long was cuz I tried to modularize the code every way possible (ofc there's still more to be done) and not hardcode each pixel/image/text at where I want them to be. I feel that this needs to be tackled as early as possible to avoid headache down the line.

Overall very satisfied with today!
