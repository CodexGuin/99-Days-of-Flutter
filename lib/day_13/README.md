# Day 12 - Flutter x Firebase 2

## Brief
Flutter implementation with Firebase, the official retry. Going to redesign my app landing page yet again, more iterations = better and more knowledge! Referencing from [Mitch Koko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zohXXZBUVYI).

## Features
- Firebase authentication integration
- Home page
- Register page
- Login page
- Drawer

## Main learning points
- Page navigation (Improved)
- Minimalistic UI design
- Handling of functions in classes

## To work on / Features to be added
- Implement other pages
- Implement home page items

## Today todo
- [x] Landing page
- [x] Login page
- [x] Register page
- [x] Firebase implementation
- [x] Home page
- [x] Drawer
- [x] Forgot password

## Bugs
- After loging out, pressing the back button on the login screen freezes the app. Unsure why. (Fixed, kinda)

## Self-reflection for the day
Mid day commit, didnt do much, just implemented the forgot password page, fix up drawer, and fix the bug above. Am worried about my lack of attention to secrets, so fretting about it now. Might spend 1 - 2 more days max on this project. May continue at night as well.

## Final Product
