# Day 9 - Rest API 4

## Brief
Attempted to recreate what I did previously, but more structured.

## Features
- HTTP GET request from endpoint
- Parsing of Json files to something usable
- Business logic seperated from frontend
- Different pages
- Kinda aesthetic UI ( NEED WORK )

## Main learning points
- Android Gradel
- Asynchronos function
- Layout

## To work on / Features to be added
- UI/UX ( In progress )
- Themeing
- BLoC / Provider etc
- Unsure if enums are needed
- Other pages ( 2 / 4 )
- Map api ( Done )

## Today todo
- Implement nearby location bus stop ( Map only )
- Beautify UI ( Search page redesign )
- Fix bugs and understand Bus.dart fully ( A little )
- Fix bus arrival logic ( Not done )
- Add home screen ( Done )

## Bugs
- Possible crashes if something 'required' is null
- Possible overflow due to layout problems

## Self-reflection for the day
Surprisingly, spent even lesser time today than yesterday according to WakaTime, 1.5 hrs, but learnt more. Fixed async issues with map for realtime location. Modularized some classes (1). Might spend just 1 more day on this, then hope onto other stuff and get back to this at a later period.
