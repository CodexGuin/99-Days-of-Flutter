## To work on / Features to be added

## Today todo
- [x] Main page UI
- [x] Modular design
- [x] Dark theme
- [ ] Theme changer
- [x] Provider
- [x] Chat page (Not fully done)

## Self-reflection for the day
Mainly wanted to refactor the code and make it better. Adjusted UIs to make it friendlier too. I think I did a pretty good job for 1.5hr of work. Created a simple chat page, still havent populate it with the convos yet.

Implemented providers and functions for adding, deleting, and pinning convos using it. Fully functional!

Might skip tomorrow, graduation ceremony day!
