# Day 12 - Flutter x Firebase 2

## Brief
Flutter implementation with Firebase, the official retry. Going to redesign my app landing page yet again, more iterations = better and more knowledge! Referencing from [Mitch Koko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zohXXZBUVYI).

## Features
- Firebase authentication integration
- Home page
- Register page
- Login page
- Drawer

## Main learning points
- Page navigation (Improved)
- Minimalistic UI design
- Handling of functions in classes

## To work on / Features to be added
- Finish up drawer
- Implement home page items

## Today todo
- [x] Landing page
- [x] Login page
- [x] Register page
- [x] Firebase implementation
- [x] Home page
- [x] Drawer
- [x] Forgot password

## Bugs
- After loging out, pressing the back button on the login screen freezes the app. Unsure why.

## Self-reflection for the day
Picked up the pace a little today again, though still not spending nearly as much as I want.

Managed to implement the full suite of register, login, home, and drawers, with working Firebase authentication! Process was pretty smooth.

## Final Product
Registration of user with Firebase Auth
