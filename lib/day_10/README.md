## Self-reflection for the day
Really proud of myself today, pretty much fully understood what Provider is and how it is used. 

After implmenting the counter example, tried to put what I learnt to implement a slightly more complex shopping cart system. After abit, I got it to work! Definetely not without hiccups tho. 

One hurdle I had to go thru was the understanding of where to place my item data. This might still be the wrong way to do it, but I'm storing the data within the provider class itself.

All in all am still very satisfied with the results today!
